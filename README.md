**Probem Statement**

You are given a set of jobs. Each job j has a start time sj and finish
time fj . It also has a weight vj . Two jobs are compatible, if they
do not overlap. Goal is to find maximum weight subset of mutually
compatible jobs. Run your program on the two inputs provided (You
will get partial credit for running it on only one of them). You have
to output the maximum weight - not the actual subset. Following is
a toy example.

Input:
Job Start Time (sj) Finish Time (fj) Weight (vj)
A 1 2 50
B 3 5 30
C 6 19 100
D 2 100 200

Output: 250
